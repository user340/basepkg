The NetBSD build system requires a shell that supports modern POSIX
features, as well as the "local" keyword in functions (which is a
widely-implemented but non-standardised feature).

Please re-run this script under a suitable shell.  For example:

	/path/to/suitable/shell $0 ...

The above command will usually enable build.sh to automatically set
HOST_SH=/path/to/suitable/shell, but if that fails, then you may also
need to explicitly set the HOST_SH environment variable, as follows:

	HOST_SH=/path/to/suitable/shell
	export HOST_SH
	\${HOST_SH} $0 ...
EOF
    exit 1
