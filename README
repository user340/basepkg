BASEPKG – NETBSD SYSTEM PACKAGES


The basepkg is unofficial experimental stage of NetBSD syspkg project.

This software is unstable. It may destroy your system. We recommend that
use chroot environment or virtual machine for testing generated
packages.

Please contact to Yuuki Enomoto uki@e-yuuki.org for bug-report,
question, discussion, patche donation and others. Or you can use GitHub
issues and pull-requests for these things.

1. Usage

1.1. Build the NetBSD distribution

  Version   Machine Architecture   Architecture
  --------- ---------------------- --------------
  current   amd64                  x86_64

  Directory    Description
  ------------ --------------------------
  /usr/src     NetBSD source tree
  /usr/xsrc    NetBSD X11 source tree
  /usr/tools   Build tools
  /usr/obj     Sets of compiled objects

This is description how to build NetBSD source tree. You can skip until
section 1.2. Install pkgtools/pkg_install if you understand it or done.

Firstly, download NetBSD source sets from FTP server. Then extract it
into /usr/src directory.

    # ftp ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-8.0/source/
    ...
    ftp> mget .tgz
    ...
    ftp> bye
    # ls | grep 'tgz$' | xargs -n 1 -I % tar zxf -C /
    # ls | grep 'tgz$' | xargs rm

Build it using build.sh.

    # mkdir /usr/obj /usr/tools
    # cd /usr/src
    # ./build.sh -O ../obj -T ../tools -x -X ../xsrc tools
    # ./build.sh -O ../obj -T ../tools -x -X ../xsrc distribution

1.2. Install pkgtools/pkg_install

basepkg is tested by latest pkgtools/pkg_install package. We recommend
that install it from pkgsrc for basepkg.sh.

This is way of get pkgsrc. Skip the section if you understand or done
it.

    # ftp ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/stable/pkgsrc.tar.gz
    # tar zxf pkgsrc.tar.gz -C /usr
    # rm pkgsrc.tar.gz

Run make install clean clean-depends.

    # cd /usr/pkgsrc/pkgtools/pkg\_install
    # make install clean clean-depends

Or you can use pkgin instead of pkgsrc. pkgin is a binary package
manager for pkgsrc.

1.3. Run basepkg.sh

Run basepkg.sh with pkg and kern option.

    # ./basepkg.sh pkg
    # ./basepkg.sh kern

Packages are created under the packages//- directory.

1.4. How to install package

Running pkg_add. If you want to use other database than pkgsrc, you can
use -K /var/db/basepkg option for separate database from pkgsrc.

    # pkg\_add -K /var/db/basepkg games-games-bin-7.1.tgz

But “etc” categorized packages are exception. They are installed to
/var/tmp/basepkg directory because the way keeps from overwrite existing
files under the /etc. If you want to update the configuration files,
please run etcupdate(8) manually.

    # etcupdate -s /var/tmp/basepkg

1.5. pkgsrc-wip

basepkg is imported to pkgsrc-wip. You can install basepkg to your
system using pkgsrc-wip. But it supporting only latest version package.

    # cd /usr/pkgsrc/wip/basepkg
    # make install clean clean-depends

basepkg.sh, README and others are installed to /usr/pkg/basepkg. You can
run basepkg.sh on /usr/pkg/basepkg directory. Packages are generated in
/usr/pkg/basepkg/packages directory.


2. Background

2.1. syspkgs

NetBSD Wiki described, “syspkgs is the concept of using pkgsrc’s pkg_*
tools to maintain the base system. … There has been a lot of work in
this area already, but it has not yet been finalized.” in
https://wiki.netbsd.org/projects/project/syspkgs

The basepkg is intend to become a successor to syspkg. But basepkg is
third-party software less like syspkg. It is an unofficial project of
NetBSD.

2.2. Goal

We intend to efficient base system management by package on NetBSD. The
way of update NetBSD base system are (1) build.sh and (2) download
tarballs from FTP server. But the first way takes a long time to compile
source tree. The second way is dengerous.

A lot of Linux distributions (GNU/Linux) such as Debian and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) has the very fast method for updating own
system. These are “package” and “package manager”. GNU/Linux and BSD
Unix has different background about histories and the way of distribute.
It is difficult to make simple comparisons for this reason. However
“package” have been active for more than 20 years. Management of
whole/part of the system is very easy in GNU/Linux.

So we decided to use “package” for NetBSD base system. It is difficult
as the example of syspkg illustrates. But it will provides benefit for
NetBSD users.

2.3. Presentations

The presentations about basepkg are here.

3. TODO

-   Develop the auto update mechanism for “sets” (including comments,
    deps, lists, and others).
-   Review +INSTALL and +DEINSTALL.
-   Support pkgin(1).
-   Provide package repository for pkgin(1).
-   Support “source package” like as source RPM.
-   Research “package” background from a viewpoint of Unix community,
    internet, and others.
-   Improve documentation (including online manual, guidebook for
    develop, about basepkg architecture, …).
-   Import to pkgsrc from pkgsrc-wip.
-   See GitHub Issue
